AMIOK?
------

Small tool to check if all the virtual hosts defined in your Apache
configuration respond to HTTP requests.

    $ gem install amiok
    $ amiok

== Why would I do that?

Well, sometimes on shared hosts applications share an environment and you
accidentally broke all of them by updating Rubygems (ahum). That tought
you to write a short solution so you can quickly check all your websites!
